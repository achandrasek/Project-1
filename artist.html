  <p>This song is extremely special to me, as I heard it for the first time on vinyl which my best friend gifted me. </p>
  <p>It's a 12 minute vivid story about the shooting of a friuend of Kendrick's brother, and each verse in the song is a detailed perspective of each person involved in the crime, and Kendrick using the story for his music</p>
